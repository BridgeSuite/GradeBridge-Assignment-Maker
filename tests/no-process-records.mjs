// Reports, handoffs, directives, session notes, milestone reports, memos and
// start-here files are how one working session hands off to the next. They are
// not developer documentation, they name people and describe individual pieces
// of coursework, and this repository is public.
//
// **An ignore file is not a guard.** The `.gitignore` block for these existed,
// with a comment explaining the reasoning, while nineteen of them were tracked
// anyway — added before the block was written, or added with `-f`. `.gitignore`
// says nothing about a file that is already in the index. This does.
//
// **There is no exemption list, deliberately.** A document that genuinely
// belongs to developers gets a name that is not a process-record name —
// `README.md`, `ASSIGNMENT_MD_SPEC.md`, `tests/README.md`. An exemption list is
// where the next process record comes to live.
//
// ADOPTED FROM THE STUDENT SUBMISSION REPOSITORY, 2026-09-03, which is the
// canonical copy of this file. Exactly two paragraphs above differ: the
// examples name this repository's own contracts, and the account of how
// nineteen came to be tracked drops a detail belonging to that repository's
// tree (a capture folder this one does not have). Everything below is verbatim,
// including the note on PROCESS_RECORD that nine arrived in subdirectories —
// that is the canonical copy's history, kept rather than localised, because the
// point it makes (these arrive at any depth) is true of both.
//
// The rule enforced is the one in `docs/session/README.md` — work orders,
// handoffs, completion records, corrections and reports live in `docs/session/`
// and are not tracked. **The pattern list below is wider than those five
// prefixes**, and deliberately kept as it is rather than trimmed to match: it is
// a superset, it flags nothing here, and two copies of one rule that differ only
// in strictness are how the rule stops being one rule. `docs/session/README.md`
// is the single tracked file in that folder and needs no exemption — a README is
// not a process-record name.
