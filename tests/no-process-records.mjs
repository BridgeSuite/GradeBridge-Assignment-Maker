// =====================================================
// No process record is tracked
// =====================================================
// Reports, handoffs, directives, session notes, milestone reports, memos and
// start-here files are how one working session hands off to the next. They are
// not developer documentation, they name people and describe individual pieces
// of coursework, and this repository is public.
//
// **An ignore file is not a guard.** The `.gitignore` block for these existed,
// with a comment explaining the reasoning, while nineteen of them were tracked
// anyway: nine under `tests/captures/`, which the patterns did not reach, and
// the rest added before the block was written or added with `-f`. `.gitignore`
// says nothing about a file that is already in the index. This does.
//
// **There is no exemption list, deliberately.** A document that genuinely
// belongs to developers gets a name that is not a process-record name —
// `README.md`, `AUTOGRADER_ZIP_SPEC.md`, `tests/captures/BASELINE_*.md`. An
// exemption list is where the next process record comes to live.
// ADOPTED VERBATIM FROM THE STUDENT SUBMISSION REPOSITORY, which is canonical
// for this file. **Everything below this comment is byte-for-byte that copy**,
// so re-adopting when it moves again is a plain overwrite plus this block —
// not a merge. Do not edit the body here; edit it there.
//
// Three statements above describe THAT repository's tree rather than this one,
// and are kept rather than localised so the two files stay comparable:
//
//   * "nine under `tests/captures/`" — this repository has no capture folder.
//     Its nineteen arrived at the root and under `docs/session/`.
//   * the examples of legitimate names — here they are `ASSIGNMENT_MD_SPEC.md`,
//     `tests/README.md` and `docs/session/README.md`.
//   * CLEAN's "real filenames from this repository" — `AUTOGRADER_ZIP_SPEC.md`,
//     `BASELINE_2026-09-01.md` and `LABELS.csv` are that repository's. They are
//     strings fed to the matcher, so they test it equally well from here, and
//     the case that actually matters — `README.md` — is common to both.
//
// The rule enforced is the one in `docs/session/README.md`: work orders,
// handoffs, completion records, corrections and reports live in `docs/session/`
// and are not tracked. The pattern list is WIDER than those five prefixes and is
// kept wide deliberately — it is a superset, it flags nothing here, and two
// copies of one rule differing only in strictness is how a rule stops being one
// rule. `docs/session/README.md` needs no exemption: a README is not a
// process-record name.

   *
   * The first version of this built each name from the pattern it was meant to
   * exercise, on the reasoning that a hand-maintained list stops being
   * maintained. It was self-fulfilling and a mutation proved it: corrupting
   * `^COMPLETION_` to `^COMPLETIONXX_` also corrupted the filename derived from
   * it, the two still matched, and the self-check passed. **A fixture generated
   * from the thing under test cannot test it** — it can only detect the thing
   * being deleted, never changed.
   *
   * So these are literal, and the coverage assertion below is what keeps the
   * hand-maintenance honest: a pattern that no name here matches fails, so
   * adding a pattern without a case is caught even though the case is manual.
   *
   * **They are filenames, and a filename is where a personal name hides.** The
   * first version of this list carried a real colleague's name in a plausible
   * brief filename, and `no-personal-names.mjs` — which scans this file like
   * every other — refused it. Keep them descriptive: a course code, a subject,
   * a date.
